                    Hi, my name is Daniel Esteban. I’m 18 years old and a full-stack developer with experience in building web solutions, both on the frontend and backend. For over a year, I’ve been working on projects that combine personal and professional development, using technologies such as React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and SQL Server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I consider myself proactive, self-taught, and focused on delivering real value in every project I take part in. I enjoy working in teams, sharing ideas, and learning from others. My goal is always to build functional, scalable solutions with a user-centered mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of my medium-term goals is to build a self-sustaining business, which reflects my mindset towards growth, independence, and efficiency. I’m also passionate about strengthening my skills in software development, learning new technologies, and taking on challenges that push me both technically and creatively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I’m currently looking for opportunities where I can continue growing professionally, contribute with my knowledge, and learn within a dynamic and collaborative environment. If you're looking for someone who is committed, eager to improve, and quick to adapt, I’m ready to take on that role.
                </p>
